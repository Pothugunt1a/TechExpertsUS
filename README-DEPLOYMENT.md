# Tech Expertsus - cPanel Deployment

Your application is now ready for cPanel deployment! 🚀

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Automated Preparation (Recommended)

Run the preparation script:

```bash
./prepare-cpanel-deploy.sh
```

This script will:
- ✅ Install all dependencies
- ✅ Build your application for production
- ✅ Verify the build output
- ✅ Generate a secure session secret
- ✅ Show you next steps

### Option 2: Manual Preparation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build

# Generate session secret
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

## Documentation Files Created

I've created comprehensive deployment documentation:

1. **`CPANEL_DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Complete step-by-step deployment guide
   - Prerequisites and requirements
   - Database setup instructions
   - File upload guide
   - Environment configuration
   - Troubleshooting tips

2. **`DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`** - Interactive checklist
   - Track your deployment progress
   - Ensure nothing is missed
   - Pre and post-deployment tasks

3. **`.env.example`** - Environment variables template
   - Copy this to `.env` on your cPanel server
   - Fill in your actual database credentials

4. **`prepare-cpanel-deploy.sh`** - Automated build script
   - Prepares your application for deployment
   - Verifies everything is ready

## What Gets Deployed

After running the build, you'll upload these to cPanel:

```
your-cpanel-directory/
├── dist/
│   ├── index.js          (Backend server)
│   └── public/           (Frontend files)
│       ├── index.html
│       ├── assets/
│       └── ...
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── drizzle.config.ts
├── shared/               (Database schema)
└── .env                  (Create on server)
```

## Deployment Steps Overview

1. **Prepare** (On Replit/Local)
   ```bash
   ./prepare-cpanel-deploy.sh
   ```

2. **Upload Files** (To cPanel)
   - Upload the files listed above

3. **Setup Database** (cPanel)
   - Create PostgreSQL database
   - Create database user
   - Note credentials

4. **Configure Environment** (cPanel)
   - Create `.env` file with your credentials
   - Set DATABASE_URL, NODE_ENV, PORT, SESSION_SECRET

5. **Install Dependencies** (cPanel via SSH)
   ```bash
   cd ~/your-app-folder
   npm install --production
   ```

6. **Setup Database Tables** (cPanel via SSH)
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

7. **Start Application** (cPanel)
   - Use Node.js App Manager in cPanel, or
   - Use PM2: `pm2 start dist/index.js --name tech-expertsus`

8. **Test**
   - Visit your domain
   - Test all pages work
   - Check for errors

## Current Application Features

Your application includes:

✅ **Multi-page website:**
- Home (with carousel and About.png background)
- About
- Services (with Services.webp banner - 40% overlay)
- Consult
- Contact (with Contactmap.jpg Business Hours background - 30% overlay)

✅ **Full-stack setup:**
- React frontend with Vite
- Express backend
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
- Session management
- Dark mode support

✅ **Production-ready:**
- Build scripts configured
- Static file serving
- Environment variable support
- Error handling

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Requirements:**
- Node.js 20.x required
- PostgreSQL database required
- 512MB RAM minimum (1GB+ recommended)

⚠️ **Security:**
- Never commit `.env` file to git
- Use strong SESSION_SECRET (generated by the script)
- Use strong database password

⚠️ **First Deployment:**
- Follow `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` carefully
- Don't skip database setup steps
- Test locally first if possible

## Getting Help

1. **Read the guides:**
   - `CPANEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions
   - `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` for step-by-step guidance

2. **Common issues:**
   - Application won't start → Check DATABASE_URL
   - 404 errors → Verify dist/public folder uploaded
   - Database errors → Check PostgreSQL connection

3. **Contact support:**
   - Your cPanel hosting provider for server issues
   - PostgreSQL/Node.js specific questions

## After Deployment

Once live, you can:
- Access your site via your domain
- Monitor logs via cPanel or PM2
- Make updates by rebuilding and re-uploading
- Scale as needed
